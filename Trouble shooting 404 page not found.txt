Trouble shooting 404 page not found for my github page 				Current date: September 15, 2023

When attempting to deploy no error message was recieved, nothing changed in the repo. I clicked save after selecting the source, and nothing happened.
Repo contains an index.html file, all spelling is accurate. No spaces left in the name of the files.
Reviewed GitHub's guides for deploying and configuring the publishing source, ensured I wasn't missing any steps or doing anything incorrectly.

Used the Xpert Learning Assistant:

Main branch is current and up to date with the latest version of project code
GitHub pages is set to deploy from the main branch from the folder
All file paths and naming conventions are accurate, verified by the fact that I can run the code, display it in the browser and view the page locally.
I deployed the page Wednesday, September 13, so I would assume enough time has passed for the site to be built.

Referred to the GitHub pages support page and followed their troubleshooting 404 errors guide:

GitHub's status page reports no incidents and all systems report as operational
Repository meets all requirements to deploy

Searched through GitHub community discussions for similar issues:
Found more 404 troubleshooting guides, most the information was more of the same


To try next ??
Create a new branch and change publishing source to new branch instead of main
Create a /docs folder, move my files, update and verify links, change publishing source to /docs instead of /(root)
Create new repo and push my files there


Created new branch named 'deploy-branch'. No changes were made to the files or directory, I simply pulled the main branch local, created new branch, commited and push the files. Then changed publishing source to 'deploy-branch', page loads, no 404. Not sure why page would not deploy from the main branch.
